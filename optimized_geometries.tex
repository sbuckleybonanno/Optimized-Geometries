We consider two-dimensional sub-wavelength lattices of quantum emitters which interact via resonant dipole-dipole interactions. The emitters are assumed to be two-level stems with a ground state $\ket{g}$ and an excited state $\ket{e}$ with a trasition frequency $\omega_L = c k_L$, such that $k_L = 2\pi/\lambda_L$ denotes the related wavenumber with the resonance wavelegth $\lambda_L$. Pairwise resonant dipole-dipole interactions among emitters result in collective couplings $J_{ij}$ and collective decay rates $\Gamma_{ij}$ between emitters $i$ and $j$ at positions $\rr_i$ and $\rr_j$, given by 
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align} J_{ij} = -\frac{3\pi \sqrt{\gamma_i \gamma_j}}{\omega_L} {\hat{d}^\dagger}_i \cdot \textbf{Re} [\textbf{G}(\textbf{r}_{ij}, \omega_L)] \cdot \hat{d}_j 
    \label{eqn:J} \\
    \Gamma_{ij} = \frac{6\pi \sqrt{\gamma_i \gamma_j}}{\omega_L} {\hat{d}^\dagger}_i \cdot \textbf{Im} [\textbf{G}(\textbf{r}_{ij},\omega_L)] \cdot \hat{d}_j 
    \label{eqn:Gamma} 
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

% \commentTP{Make this and all the others into subequations}
where $\gamma_i$ and $\gamma_j$ are the decay rates of the individual dipoles $i$ and $j$, and $\rr_{ij} = \rr_i - r_j$ is the displacement vector. $\textbf{G}(\textbf{r}_{ij}, \omega_L)$ is the Green's tensor, defined as 

\begin{multline} 
    G_{\alpha\beta} (\textbf{r}, \omega) = \frac{e^{i\omega r}}{4\pi r} \left[ \left( 1 + \frac{i}{\omega r} - \frac{1}{\omega^2 r^2} \right) \delta_{\alpha\beta}
    \right. \\ \left. 
    - \left( 1 + \frac{3i}{\omega r} - \frac{3}{\omega^2 r^2} \right) \frac{r_\alpha r_\beta}{r^2} \right] - \frac{\delta(\textbf{r})}{3\omega^2} \delta_{\alpha\beta} 
    \label{eqn:Green}
\end{multline}

$d_i$ and $d_j$ are the dipole polarizations, which are set to be uniformly circular, so that $ \hat{d}_L = \hat{d}_I = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 
    1 && i && 0 
\end{pmatrix} ^T
\label{eqn:polarization} $
where $\hat{d}_L$ is the polarization of the lattice dipoles, and $\hat{d}_I$ is the polarization of any impurities. This polarization ensures that the dynamics of the system depend purely on the relative distances $r_{ij}$ between pairs of dipoles, independent of their relative orientations. As a result, $J_{ij}$ and $\Gamma_{ij}$ can be written as 
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
    J_{ij} = -\frac{3}{8 \omega_L r_{ij}} \left( \cos (\omega_L r_{ij}) + \frac{\sin (\omega_L r_{ij})}{\omega_L r_{ij}} + \frac{\cos (\omega_L r_{ij})}{(\omega_L r_{ij})^2} \right) \\
    \Gamma_{ij} = \frac{3}{4\omega_L r_{ij}} \left( \sin(\omega_L r_{ij}) - \frac{\cos(\omega_L r_{ij})}{\omega_L r_{ij}} + \frac{\sin(\omega_L r_{ij})}{(\omega_L r_{ij})^2} \right) 
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
In this way, collective couplings (\fref{fig:J_r}) and collective decay rates (\fref{fig:Gamma_r}) depend purely on the relative distances $r_{ij}$ between pairs of dipoles, independent of their relative orientations.

Into this lattice, we place one or two lattice impurities with transition frequency $\omega_I \approx \omega_L$. The overall Hamiltonian is $H = H_L + H_{LI} + H_{I}$, where $H_L$ is the Hamiltonian of the lattice, $H_{LI}$ is the Hamiltonian for the interaction between the lattice and any impurities, and $H_{I}$ is for the interactions involving just impurities. These Hamiltonians are defined such that  

\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}   
        H_L = \sum_i^{N_L} \left( \omega_L - \frac{i}{2} \gamma_L \right) \sigma_i^\dag \sigma_i + \sum_{i,j \neq i}^{N_L} \left( J_{ij} - \frac{i}{2} \Gamma_{ij} \right) \sigma_i^\dag \sigma_j \\
        H_{LI} = \sum_{i}^{N_L}  \sum_{j}^{N_I} \left[ \left( J_{ij} - \frac{i}{2} \Gamma_{ij} \right) \sigma_i^\dag s_j + \left( J_{ji} - \frac{i}{2} \Gamma_{ji} \right) s_j^\dag \sigma_i \right] \\
        H_I = \sum_j^{N_I} \left( \omega_I - \frac{i}{2} \gamma_I \right) s_j^\dag s_j + \sum_{i,j \neq i}^{N_I} \left( J_{ij} - \frac{i}{2} \Gamma_{ij} \right) s_i^\dag s_j
        \label{eqn:Hamiltonian}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

where $N_L$ is the number of lattice atoms, $\sigma_i$ is the lowering operator for lattice atom $i$, $N_I$ is the number of impurities, and $s_j$ is the lowering operator for impurity $j$.

The generic form of the Hamiltonian for a given lattice of $N$ atoms along with a single impurity is 

% \begin{equation}
%     H = \begin{pmatrix}
%         H_{11} & H_{12} & \cdots & H_{1N}  &  C_{LI,1}\\ 
%         H_{21} & H_{22} & & H_{2N}         & C_{LI,2} \\
%         \vdots & & \ddots & \vdots         & \vdots  \\
%         H_{N1} & H_{N2} & \cdots & H_{NN} & C_{LI,N} \\
%         C_{IL,1} & C_{IL,2} & \cdots & C_{IL,N} & H_I   
%     \end{pmatrix}
% \end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    H = \begin{pmatrix}
        ~ & ~ & ~ &   C_{LI} \\ 
        ~ & H_L & ~ & \vdots \\
        ~ & ~ & ~ & C_{LI} & \\
        C_{IL} & \cdots & C_{IL} & H_I   
    \end{pmatrix}
    \label{eqn:blockH1}
\end{equation}
where $H_L$ represents the $N \times N$ matrix of terms for the lattice's own Hamiltonian, $H_I$ is the lattice, and $C_{IL}$ along with $C_{LI}$ represent the coupling terms between the lattice atoms and the impurity. 
% \commentSB{Firstly, is there some better notation than this, especially $C_{IL,1}$, with that comma there. Secondly, does $C_{IL,1} = C_{LI,1}$, or is there some other symmetry that can be exploited in the notation?}

Define the wavefunction such that
$ \psi = 
\begin{pmatrix}
    b_1 && \vdots && b_N && c
\end{pmatrix}^T 
\label{eqn:psi} $,
and assume that the lattice occupies a steady state, so that the Schr\"odinger equation is

\begin{equation} i \hbar 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ \dot{c}
    \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
        ~ & ~ & ~ &   C_{LI} \\ 
        ~ & H_L & ~ & \vdots \\
        ~ & ~ & ~ & C_{LI} & \\
        C_{IL} & \cdots & C_{IL} & H_I   
    \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
        b_1 \\ \vdots \\ b_N \\ c
    \end{pmatrix} 
\end{equation}
This can be solved to get 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        b_1 \\ \vdots \\ b_N
    \end{pmatrix} = - H_L^{-1} C_{LI} c
\end{equation}
Putting this back into the Schr\"odinger equation produces 
\begin{equation}
    \dot{c} = -i (H_I - C_{IL}^T H_L^{-1}C_{LI}) c
\end{equation}
Recognizing that $ H_I - C_{IL}^T (H_L^{-1}) C_{LI} = \Sigma_I - i \frac{\gamma_I}{2} $, we can calculate the impurity's self-energy $\Sigma_I$ to be 
% \commentSB{Should this identification be justified?}
\begin{equation}
    \Sigma_I = H_I - C_{IL}^T (H_L^{-1}) C_{LI} + i \frac{\gamma_I}{2}
    \label{eqn:selfenergy}
\end{equation}
The effective decay rate $\Gamma_\text{eff}$ for an impurity in the lattice is related to this self-energy according to 
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_\text{eff} = \gamma_I - 2~\im[\Sigma_I]
\end{equation}

Equipped with these mathematical tools, we consider the full range of non-centered Bravais lattices, for both interstitial and substitutional impurity positions, as illustrated in \fref{fig:Bravais}. In order to reasonably compare lattices of differing geometries, we ensure, whenever possible, that all plaquettes possess the same area throughout all possible transformations.

    \label{fig:interstitial}
\end{figure*}

Consider a finite square lattice, with an inter-atomic spacing of $a = 0.2$, defined as a function of the lattice's resonant wavelength. Compare this to the other Bravais lattices, namely a triangular lattice, and monoclinic lattice defined over $\theta$ from $\pi/2$ to $0$, and a rectangular lattice with a scaling factor $\mu$ such that the horizontal sidelength of its rectangular plaquette is $\mu a$. 
\commentSB{Which variable do we want for scaling? Does $\mu$ work?.} To ensure that the plaquettes of all of these lattices have the same area, we set the sidelength of the triangular plaquettes to $\frac{2}{3^{1/4}}a$, the height of monoclinic lattices to $a$ for all $\theta$, and the height of the rectangular lattices to $a/\mu$. 

For an interstitial impurity, the position of the impurity in the plaquette along with its detuning relative the lattice's resonant frequency determine its decay properties. Detuning is defined as $ \delta_{LI} = \omega_I - \omega_L$. For a given impurity position, $\delta_{LI}$ can be chosen to give optimal $\Gamma_\text{eff}$, by minimizing along a curve such as \fref{fig:delta_check}. By conducting this optimization for all positions within a plaquette, a map of the optimal impurity placement can be constructed. The results of this are depicted in \fref{fig:interstitial}. See the appendix for the values of $\delta_{LI}$ corresponding to these impurity positions. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/temp_delta_check_cropped.png} 
    \caption{•}
    \label{fig:delta_check}
\end{figure}

In all cases, geometric symmetries determines where the points of minimal $\Gamma_\text{eff}$ lie. The paths of minimal $\Gamma_\text{eff}$ follow the geometry of a Voronoi diagram constructed around the lattice atoms. The vertices where edges of this Voronoi partition meet are then the points of minimal $\Gamma_\text{eff}$, which are often the global minima as well. The number of edges that coincide at any one point roughly correlates to how low the effective decay rate will be compared to other such points. For instance, the center of the square plaquette, where four edges coincide, has an optimal $\Gamma_\text{eff}$ ($7.58\times 10^{-5}$ \commentSB{units}) that is approximately an order of magnitude less than the optimal $\Gamma_\text{eff}$ at the center of the triangular plaquette ($6.75\times 10^{-4}$ \commentSB{units}), where only three edges coincide. Note that this Voronoi structure does not always result in the center of the plaquette becoming the optimal position for an impurity, as demonstrated by the monoclinic case. The optimal positions are just off of the center, on the line of symmetry along the long axis of the plaquette, at a pair of points where three Voronoi edges meet. As $\theta$ approaches $\frac{\pi}{2}$, these two points merge into one, at the center of a square plaquette.

\commentSB{This sugguests that we should try a hexagonal plaquette of the same area, and that we will get an even better result from that! Not a Bravais lattice, but surely still worth a try.}

The role that symmetry plays in creating these Voronoi geometries is clear once the couplings $J_{ij}$ and $\Gamma_{ij}$ between pairs of particles are plotted over a path through the plaquette space. At points of geometric symmetry, such as the centers of plaquettes, the values of these couplings coincide. In general, the more that couplings match, the lower the $\Gamma_\text{eff}$ for an impurity placed at the point. In this way, lattices with higher degrees of symmetry (i.e. the square and triangular lattices), and with higher numbers of atoms in a single plaquette (i.e. any Bravais lattice other than the triangular lattice) possess impurity positions with the smallest $\Gamma_\text{eff}$. The fact that the square lattice posses both of these properties helps to explain why it stands out amongst the various Bravais lattices as the optimal choice. 

\commentTP{Look at the "unscaled example.png," and see how it shows that not must the nearest neighbors, but the second-nearest neighbors also matter to ensuring a small Gamma eff at the center. Then make this point in the paper, that the collective modes are not just governed by nearest neighbors.}

\subsection{Substitutional}

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/temp_substitution_figure.png} 
    \caption{•}
    \label{fig:substitution}
\end{figure*}

Now, considering substituting a lattice atom for an impurity, so that, in effect, the impurity takes up a vacancy in the lattice.
In general, the impurity positions available when an impurity is substituted for a lattice atom result in $\Gamma_\text{eff}$ that are sub-optimal compared to an interstitial impurity placement (\fref{fig:substitution}). The best positions for a substitution are also almost always off-center, as an impurity substitution in the exact position of where a lattice atom should be tends to put the $\Gamma_\text{eff}$ of the impurity in the region of a local maximum. Offsetting the impurity so that it lies approximately midway between a lattice atom and the vacancy left by the lattice atom that is replaced returns it to a local maximum. 

\commentSB{Can this argument be made more clear if we add high-contrast version of the hexagonal and rectangular plots?}

The symmetry of the lattice is already broken by substituting an offset impurity for a lattice atom, and so symmetry does not play as great a role in determining the optimal impurity position compared to the interstitial case. If there is any role for symmetry, it is between the lattice atoms and the vacancy made by the substitution, so that the impurity receives the best $\Gamma_\text{eff}$ when it sits between these points. 

\commentSB{There is surely more to say. For instance, why is the hexagonal case so much worse than the monoclinic case?}

For all Bravais lattices, across all monoclinic angles and rectangular scalings, the optimal $\Gamma_\text{eff}$ for a substitutional impurity placement is always greater than the optimal $\Gamma_\text{eff}$ for an interstitial impurity. As a result, to optimize for the longest lifetime of the impurity's excited state, an interstitial placement is best for any Bravais lattice. 

\commentSB{Demonstrate this with a figure that shows the optimal $\Gamma_\text{eff}$ for all theta and scalings. My current plot is inadequate for this, especially, since it keeps the impurity in the center of the plaquette when the best position for a monoclinic lattice is off-center.}

% Now, consider the Bravais lattices defined by variable paramters. 

% In particular, consider a monoclinic lattice defined by $\theta$, such that at $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ we recover the square lattice case with an inter-atomic spacing of $0.2$. By maintaining a constant vertical distance between the layers of the lattice, we ensure that the area of the plaquettes remains constant over the range $ 0 < \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$.

\section{Two impurity case}
\commentSO{Q-factor, analyze different lattices -> discuss the most important figures, constant distance}

$\Gamma_\text{eff}$ for a lattice with two impurities is calculated in a manner analagous to the single-impurity case, starting with the Schr\"odinger equation for the two-impurity Hamiltonian, for which 

% \commentSB{Perhaps write out the meanings of all these new variables, if it's not clear}
\begin{equation}
    i \hbar \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ \dot{c} \\ \dot{d}
    \end{pmatrix}
    = \begin{pmatrix}
        ~ & ~ & ~ &   C_{L1} & C_{L2} \\ 
        ~ & H_L & ~ & \vdots & \vdots \\
        ~ & ~ & ~ & C_{L1} &  C_{L2} \\
        C_{1L} & \cdots & C_{1L} & H_1 & C_{12} \\
        C_{2L} & \cdots & C_{2L} & C_{21} & H_2  
    \end{pmatrix} 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        b_1 \\ \vdots \\ b_N \\ c \\ d
    \end{pmatrix}
    \label{eqn:blockH2}
\end{equation} 
In this way, 
\begin{equation}
    b = -(H_L)^{-1} (C_{L1} c + C_{L2} d)
\end{equation}
Putting this result back into the Schr\"odinger equation gives
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    \dot{c} &= -i \left[  H_1 - {C_{1L}}^T (H_L)^{-1} C_{L1}\right] c \nonumber\\
     &\quad- i \left[  C_{12} - {C_{1L}}^T (H_L)^{-1} C_{L2} \right] d \\
    \dot{d} &= -i \left[  C_{21} - {C_{2L}}^T (H_L)^{-1} C_{L1} \right] c \nonumber\\
     &\quad -i \left[  H_2 - {C_{2L}}^T (H_L)^{-1} C_{L2}\right] d
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Let $\dot{c} = -i [\Sigma_1 - \frac{i \gamma_1}{2}]c - i \kappa_1 d $ and $\dot{d} = -i [ \Sigma_2 - \frac{i \gamma_2}{2} ] d - i \kappa_2 c $, where $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ are ``effective couplings.'' Solving for these and the self-energies results in 
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        \Sigma_1 = H_1 - {C_{1L}}^T (H_L)^{-1} C_{L1} + \frac{i \gamma_1}{2} \\
        \Sigma_2 = H_2 - {C_{2L}}^T (H_L)^{-1} C_{L2} + \frac{i \gamma_2}{2} \\
        \kappa_1 = C_{12} - {C_{1L}}^T (H_L)^{-1} C_{L2} \\
        \kappa_2 = C_{21} - {C_{2L}}^T (H_L)^{-1} C_{L1} 
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

The impurities' effective decay rates are determined by $\Gamma_\text{eff,i} = \gamma_1 - 2~\im[\Sigma_i]$, where $i$ stands for either the first or second impurity. Likewise, we define the Q-factor as a function of the effective decay rate and the effective coupling, so that $ Q_i = \frac{\re[\kappa_i]}{\Gamma_\text{eff,i}} $ for each of the two impurities. Because the first and second impurities occupy symmetric positions in the lattice, we find that $\Gamma_\text{eff,1} = \Gamma_\text{eff,2}$ and $Q_1 = Q_2$. We thus consolidate these variables, so that we may speak of the impurities' effective decay rate $\Gamma_\text{eff}$ and overall quality factor $Q$. 

% \commentTP{Put these in-line, and consolidate them into single equations of the form $\Gamma_\text{eff:1,2}$. And mention that the 1 and 2 equations are equal to each other because we choose that to be the case, and so we can really just atlk about a single Geff and a single Q}
