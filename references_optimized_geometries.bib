	abstract = {We present an open source computational framework geared towards the efficient numerical investigation of open quantum systems written in the Julia programming language. Built exclusively in Julia and based on standard quantum optics notation, the toolbox offers speed comparable to low-level statically typed languages, without compromising on the accessibility and code readability found in dynamic languages. After introducing the framework, we highlight its features and showcase implementations of generic quantum models. Finally, we compare its usability and performance to two well-established and widely used numerical quantum libraries.
Program summary
Program Title: QuantumOptics.jl Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/3696r5jhm4.1 Licensing provisions: MIT Programming language: Julia Supplementary material: Full list of functions (API) as html Nature of problem: Dynamics of open quantum systems Solution method: Numerically solving the Schrödinger or master equation or a Monte Carlo wave-function approach. Additional comments including Restrictions and Unusual features: The framework may be used for problems that fulfill the necessary conditions such that they can be described by a Schrödinger or master equation. Furthermore, the aim is to efficiently and easily simulate systems of moderate size rather than pushing the limits of what is possible numerically.},
